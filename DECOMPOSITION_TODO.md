# SweetMCP Rust Code Decomposition - Production Quality TODO

## OBJECTIVE
Create smaller, more manageable files that adhere to the 300-line limit while maintaining clear separation of concerns. Each new module will encapsulate specific functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

## ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY
The decomposition strategy involves identifying distinct responsibilities within each large file and extracting them into separate modules. This approach will improve code readability, reduce complexity, and make future modifications easier to implement.

## PHASE 1: COMPLETE CODEBASE AUDIT

### 1.1 Systematic File Size Audit - All Packages
**Files**: Complete SweetMCP workspace audit
**Architecture**: Comprehensive audit to identify any remaining files >300 lines across all packages, plugins, tests, and build scripts
**Implementation**: 
1. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-daemon/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300
2. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-axum/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300  
3. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-memory/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300
4. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-pingora/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300
5. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-client-autoconfig/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300
6. Audit `packages/sweetmcp-plugin-builder/src/**/*.rs` - check all source files for line count >300
7. Audit all plugin directories `plugins/*/src/**/*.rs` - check all plugin source files
8. Audit all test files `**/tests/**/*.rs` - check all test files for line count >300
9. Audit all build scripts `**/build.rs` - check all build scripts for line count >300
10. Document any files found >300 lines with exact line counts and decomposition requirements
DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
