## COGNITIVE/QUANTUM SYSTEMS DECOMPOSITION

### 1. Decompose src/cognitive/quantum/ml_decoder/training.rs (716 lines)

**Current Issues:** Single file contains decoding algorithms, training optimizers, and gradient computation - violates separation of concerns.

**Decomposition Plan:**
- **src/cognitive/quantum/ml_decoder/decoders.rs** (lines 12-167): Extract all decode_* methods
- **src/cognitive/quantum/ml_decoder/optimizers.rs** (lines 169-548): Extract all train_with_* methods  
- **src/cognitive/quantum/ml_decoder/gradients.rs** (lines 580-717): Extract all compute_*_gradients methods
- **src/cognitive/quantum/ml_decoder/training.rs** (remaining): Keep main train() method and coordination logic

**Implementation Notes:**
- Move `decode()`, `decode_quantum_neural_network()`, `decode_classical_neural_network()`, `decode_svm()`, `decode_random_forest()` to decoders.rs
- Move all optimizer implementations (Adam, SGD, RMSprop, L-BFGS, QAOA, VQE, SPSA) to optimizers.rs
- Move gradient computation methods (backprop, parameter shift, finite difference, autodiff) to gradients.rs
- Update imports and re-exports in training.rs
- Ensure all Result<T,E> error handling preserved without unwrap() calls

DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.
