## Icon Requirements

The following icon files are required for cross-platform bundle generation:

### Icon Directory (`assets/icon/`)
- `icon-32x32.png` - Small application icon (32x32 pixels)
- `icon-512x512.png` - Large application icon (512x512 pixels)
- `icon.ico` - Windows ICO format icon (multi-resolution)

### Bundle Directory (`assets/bundle/`)
- Platform-specific bundle assets and resources
- Additional metadata files for installers
- License files and documentation for bundling

## Current Status
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Placeholder PNG icons added (using sweetmcp.png)
- ⚠️ Windows ICO icon needed
- ⚠️ High-quality custom icons recommended

## Notes
- Current icons are placeholders copied from main SweetMCP branding
- For production, create custom icons specific to the terminal application
- ICO file should contain multiple resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
