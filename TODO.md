# TODO: Fix "Extracted helper failed validation" Error

## Objective
Fix the installer validation error that prevents SweetMCP installation from completing on macOS.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Check embedded APP_ZIP_DATA exists**: Verify that APP_ZIP_DATA constant contains actual ZIP data and is not empty/corrupted. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that the APP_ZIP_DATA investigation was thorough and accurately determined if the embedded data exists and is valid. Rate the work performed on completeness of data verification.

- [ ] **Identify which validation fails**: Determine if the error comes from validate_helper() or verify_code_signature() by examining the validation logic flow. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Confirm that the validation failure point was accurately identified through proper analysis. Rate the work performed on precision of failure identification.

- [ ] **Fix the specific validation failure**: Apply the minimal fix to resolve whichever validation is actually failing (helper structure or code signature). DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that the fix applied was truly minimal and surgical, addressing only the validation error without unnecessary changes. Rate the work performed on precision and minimalism of the fix.

- [ ] **Test installer validation**: Run the installer to verify the "Extracted helper failed validation" error no longer occurs. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Confirm that installer testing was properly executed and the validation error was resolved. Rate the work performed on thoroughness of end-to-end validation.
