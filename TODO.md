# TODO: Fix sweetmcp-axum Build Error

## Objective
Fix the compilation error in sweetmcp-axum that's preventing the installer from completing successfully.

## Tasks

- [ ] **Investigate sampling module structure**: Check if sampling.rs or sampling/mod.rs exists in sweetmcp-axum/src/ directory. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that the investigation was thorough and accurately identified the sampling module structure (or lack thereof). Rate the work performed on completeness and accuracy of findings.

- [ ] **Check git history for sampling module**: Search git history to determine if sampling module was recently moved, deleted, or renamed. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that git history investigation was properly conducted and findings are accurate. Rate the work performed on thoroughness of historical analysis.

- [ ] **Verify sampling exports usage**: Check all references to sampling module exports in the codebase to understand required functionality. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Confirm that all sampling module dependencies and exports were properly identified. Rate the work performed on completeness of dependency analysis.

- [ ] **Apply minimal fix for sampling module**: Based on investigation, either restore missing sampling module file, remove sampling declaration, or fix import path. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that the fix applied was truly minimal and surgical, addressing only the compilation error without unnecessary changes. Rate the work performed on precision and minimalism of the fix.

- [ ] **Test compilation**: Run `cargo build --release --package sweetmcp-axum` to verify the fix resolved the build error. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Confirm that compilation testing was properly executed and build success was verified. Rate the work performed on thoroughness of compilation verification.

- [ ] **Test installer build step**: Run the specific build command the installer uses to ensure end-to-end fix. DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

- [ ] **Act as an Objective QA Rust developer**: Verify that installer build testing was complete and successful. Rate the work performed on end-to-end validation of the fix.
