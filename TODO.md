## Architecture Decisions

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Protocol Gateway Pattern**: Pingora handles all protocol complexity, allowing Axum to focus on business logic
2. **HTTP Transport**: Industry standard, well-understood, extensive tooling support
3. **Service Mesh Ready**: Compatible with Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
4. **Cloud Native**: Kubernetes-ready with proper health checks and graceful shutdown
5. **Observable by Design**: Metrics, logs, and traces built into every component
6. **Security First**: mTLS, JWT, rate limiting, and audit logging throughout
7. **Performance Optimized**: Connection pooling, caching, and zero-copy where possible
8. **Highly Available**: No single points of failure, automatic failover
9. **Horizontally Scalable**: Both Pingora and Axum can scale independently
10. **Production Proven**: Based on patterns used by Cloudflare, Google, and others

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**:
   - P50 latency < 10ms
   - P99 latency < 50ms  
   - Throughput > 50,000 req/sec per instance
   - CPU usage < 70% at peak load
   - Memory usage < 4GB per instance

2. **Reliability**:
   - 99.99% availability (52 minutes downtime/year)
   - Zero message loss during normal operations
   - Graceful degradation under overload
   - Recovery time < 30 seconds for instance failure
   - No cascading failures

3. **Security**:
   - All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
   - mTLS between internal services
   - JWT tokens expire and refresh properly
   - Rate limiting prevents abuse
   - Audit trail for all operations

4. **Operability**:
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Automatic rollback on failure
   - Self-healing with automatic recovery
   - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Runbook automation for common issues

5. **Scalability**:
   - Linear scaling to 100+ instances
   - Multi-region deployment support
   - Automatic scaling based on load
   - Database connection pooling
   - Efficient resource utilization
