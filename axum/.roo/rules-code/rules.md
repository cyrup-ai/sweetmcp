# Roo Rules

- review CONVENTIONS.md for the next step.
- review TASKLIST.md for the next step.
- The  AI Agent (that means YOU) may ask to add, edit or delete next steps, or change the order of next steps if a more optimistic path has become clear. Cite the reasoning for requested changes and await my confirmation before continuing. If no revisions, continue below to execute.
- complete the next step and mark it off the list as done, with a brief explanation of how it was fully realized
- mark the item as completed
- repeat: `until all TASKLIST.md items are completed`
